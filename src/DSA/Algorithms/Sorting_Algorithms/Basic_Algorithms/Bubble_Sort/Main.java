        * In Bubble Sort we comparee each element by their neighbour and swap them using this condition
        *
        * if n > ( n + 1 ) swap the values; which means that if left element is bigger
        * than right element we swap them
        *
        * it is very inefficient as our comparisons grow exponentially by the number of elemnts
        * time complexity -> nÂ²
        * which means that
        * 10 elements -> 100 comparisons
        * 100 elements -> 1000 comparisons
        *
        * see how our workload increase exponentially hence bubble sort is
        * very inefficient and is not encouraged to be used
