        /*
         * In Insertion Sort we build a sorted portion of the array step by step.
         * Time complexity is O(nÂ²) in the worst case, but it performs better than
         * Bubble or Selection Sort on nearly-sorted data.
         *
         * The idea:
         *   - We divide the array into a "sorted" part (on the left) and
         *     an "unsorted" part (on the right).
         *   - One by one, we take the first element from the unsorted part
         *     and insert it into the correct place in the sorted part.
         *
         * Steps:
         *   i)   Assume the first element (index 0) is already sorted.
         *   ii)  Take the next element (array[i]) as the "key".
         *   iii) Compare key with elements in the sorted portion (array[0 ... i-1]).
         *   iv)  Shift all elements greater than key one position to the right.
         *   v)   Insert key into the correct position.
         *   vi)  Repeat until the array is fully sorted.
         *
         * Example with [5, 3, 6, 1]:
         *   - Start: [5 | 3, 6, 1]   (5 is considered sorted)
         *   - Insert 3: [3, 5 | 6, 1]
         *   - Insert 6: [3, 5, 6 | 1]
         *   - Insert 1: [1, 3, 5, 6]
         *
         * These are the steps of the Insertion Sort Algorithm.
